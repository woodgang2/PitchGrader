“_Well, this year I’m told the team did well because one pitcher had a fine curve ball. I understand that a curve ball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive. Surely this is not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard._” - A quote commonly attributed to Charles Eliot, President of Harvard, but in actuality was likely sourced from Charles Eliot Norton, Professor of the History of Art at Harvard (Hershberger, 2017).

Well, a good century has passed since this quote was first said, and times have changed. Fastballs only ever get faster, sliders have morphed into sweepers, and every pitcher now has an arsenal of secondary pitches relying primarily on deception.
